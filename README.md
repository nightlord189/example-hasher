# example-hasher

Example project to train create GRPC service.

It's a server that can calculate multiple SHA-512 hashes by array request from client.

It partially follows [Go project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) 
and implements Martin's [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles with some my own changes.
